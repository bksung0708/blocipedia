# blocipedia
Blocipedia is a Ruby on Rails application that allows users to create posts(named wiki in this application) and collaborate on other wikis. Users can pay to upgrade their membership, allowing them to view and create private wikis.

## Ruby version
2.3.0

## Features
* New user sign up
* View, post, edit, delete, and collaborate wikis
* Upgrade account with payment
* private wikis for premium users

Users can create a standard account in order to create, edit, and collaborate on public wikis using Markdown syntax. Anyone can view public wikis. Users can pay to upgrade their account to Premium in order to view and create private wikis. Premium users can allow others to view and collaborate on the private wikis they create. Premium users can downgrade their account back to Standard. When a user downgrades his or her account, his or her private wikis will automatically become public.
